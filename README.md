Battle
-----
A simple Sinatra web application

Getting Started:
-----
* `git clone github.com:CharlyMannion/battle_solo.git`
* `bundle`
* `rackup` and check that the app is running on a port `localhost:XXXX`. You should be able to visit that URL in your web browser and see `Hello Battle!`
* `rspec --init`
* check that running `rspec` returns `0 examples, 0 failures`
